# do it in languege X

for all lines of code, ask yousefl can this be done in off the shelf lua?

allow the polynorphicm trcks

there will be somethings youa re FORCED intot do e.g. in nim you
often must drop in type ceoversion e.g. sqrt(b.flat)/b.float

taht said, we are after programming tricks that transcend one
langauage, can be learned in one and applied to anohere
