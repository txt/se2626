SE and AI. NCSU SE 426/526. Spring 2026.

## Catalog Description 


AI presents unique challenges and opportunities when applied to software engineering. Unlike other domains, SE involves evolving requirements, human-in-the-loop decisions, and complex socio-technical ecosystems, making the integration of AI both powerful and precarious. This course will explore AI methods for SE, such as explainable AI, classification and clustering, multi-objective optimization, semi-supervised learning (useful when labeled data is scarce), theorem proving and logical reasoning, and generative methods enable code suggestion, test generation, and documentation support.

426 adn 526:

- Students will apply sound research methods/tools to problems in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Students will analyze/interpret research data
- Students will communicate their research clearly and professionally in both written and oral forms appropriate to “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”    

526:
- State a research problem in such a way that it clearly fits within the context of the literature in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” 
- Demonstrate the value of a research solution to the research problem in advancing knowledge within that area
